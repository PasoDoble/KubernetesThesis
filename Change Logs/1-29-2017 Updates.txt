Updated On-Demand costs to the latest values
Updated calculations of baseline and equivalents to use Amazon's new measure of EC2 Compute Unit: They're method of comparing computing power between instance types
	- InstanceTypeDefinition class to support new factor in place of CPU speed and number
	- InstanceDictionary now initializes with these instead of CPU info
	- All locations comparing computing power has been updated to use ECU instead of the available speed and number of cores as it was before
With new pricing, had to change On-Demand algorithm to find the best Price Per Baseline for On-Demand instances
Updated sort formerly used for sorting by number of baselines per instance to sort by price per on demand baseline
