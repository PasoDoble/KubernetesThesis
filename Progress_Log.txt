Week 2/12 - 2/19: Began writing background of Thesis proposal. This included what the benefits and drawbacks to Google and Amazon as providers are, the general idea of Kubernetes and how to use it, a very rough structure to my overall system design.
Week 2/19 - 2/26: Continued writing thesis background, specifically adding more information on Kubernetes, fault tolerance, master-minion hierarchy, and more. Also began setting up Kubernetes in the Google cloud to begin testing how I might work with it.
Week 2/26 - 3/4: Began design work on algorithm and came up with a first draft of algorithm without implementation.
